The tool allows you to quickly generate a robust Express template based on your preferences.

## Features
- Customizable project setup:
    - Choose between JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or Express Session for authentication.
- Support for SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL with Sequelize.
- TypeScript integration for type safety.
- Pre-configured authentication and user routes.
- Flexible file structure to get started with RESTful APIs.

Follow these steps to get started with Quad App CLI:

1. Install Globally (Optional)

    You can install the package globally to use it anywhere:

`
npm install -g quad-app
`

2. Use Without Installation (Preferred)
